<p>Advisor: Prof. <a href='http://www.bestmannlab.com/team'>Bestmann, Sven</a></p>
<p><strong>Project (Independent): <a href='/traveling-wave/'>Simulation &amp; Detection of Cortical Traveling Waves</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Simulated stable mesoscopic cortical traveling waves of different speeds, in different frequency bands under different levels of Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR), with more than 300,000 trials in total</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantified the precision of linear-regression-based estimation of wave orientation and speed </li>
<li>Illustrated that the estimation of orientation improved as SNR and spatial frequency increased, but there might be an optimal spatial frequency interval for the estimation of speed</li>
<li>Found that performing a single regression at each time point would be generally better than over the whole trial, and estimating by the median of speed distribution would be more accurate than the mean</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Simulated dynamic macroscopic spherical traveling wave with rapidly changing sources, and evaluated the performance of different traveling wave detection algorithms on the dataset (<a href='https://rq-chen.github.io/traveling-wave/Exp1/'>Link</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Revealed that neither the clustering method in <a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0148413'>(Alexander et. al., 2016)</a> nor the PCA method in <a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007316'>(Alexander et. al., 2019)</a>  could reliably classify the spatial structure of the traveling wave</li>
<li>Demonstrated that directly clustering the data samples at each time point provided satisfactory results and common phase offset removal might increase the sensitivity of the clustering algorithm</li>
