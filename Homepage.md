# Welcome to Ruiqi Chen's Homepage



Hello, I'm Ruiqi Chen, a junior student from Peking University (PKU), China. I major in Intelligence Science and Technology at the Department of Machine Intelligence, and I am most interested in cognitive science. I plan to apply for PhD programs in cognitive science in the US, now urgently seeking for relevant information. Please contact me if you could help and I would appreciate it a lot.

**You can find me at (firstname)(lastname)(AT)(pku)(DOT)(edu)(DOT)(com).**

**You can download my CV [here](Ruiqi_Chen_CV_Full.pdf).**



## News

- I trained a deep residual network with Keras on CIFAR10 and achieved high accuracy. ([Details](deep-learning-startup/index.html))
