**Mapping cognition to neural activation, not the reversed**

Tsao's paper on the functional mapping of lateral visual stream is ground-breaking, in the sense that, rather than mapping different types of visual stimuli to different cortical areas, they classified the visual stimuli according to the activation of different cortical area, i.e. they randomly generate stimuli for viewing, and conclude the shared property of the stimuli activating the same area.

This is somehow related to the notion of factor analysis, or the graph-modeling method in psychiatry. That is, we can find out the shared features in seemingly unrelated cognitive functions. This is particularly important when these shared features are supported by a same neural mechanism, which means that our theory- or intuition-driven classification of cognitive processes is indeed wrong.

For example, the most important contribution of this paper is that it shows how "high-level" cognitive and neural processes may actually be resolved into "low-level", statistic-driven computations. We may hypothesize that there is some cortical area responsible for face processing, object processing or so, which is actually based on our intuition, constraint by our language. But Tsao demonstrates that, from a data-driven perspective, the distinction is only about ratio. This is also very closely related to computer vision, where the extracted feature can be quite weird according to our intuition. But what if our visual system is indeed operating on, and organized by, these statistic-driven features, rather than something abstract like "concepts"?
