## News

- I attended the 2023 annual meeting of Cognitive Neuroscience Society and presented our poster *E43 - Complementary benefits of hierarchical modeling and MVPA for identifying individual differences in cognitive control*. Download the poster [here](/test-retest-reliability/TRR_Poster_Final.pdf)!
- My rotation project using fMRI network connectivity to predict individual traits are now published on [Neuroimage: Reports](https://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S2666-9560(23)00008-9)!
- I will be jointly supervised by [Dr. ShiNung Ching](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/ShiNung-Ching.html) and [Dr. Todd Braver](https://sites.wustl.edu/ccplab/) through the rest of my graduate study!
- I have been working on my third rotation with [Dr. Todd Braver](https://sites.wustl.edu/ccplab/) and [Michael Freund](https://sites.wustl.edu/ccplab/people/michael-freund/). We investigated the use of hierarchical Bayesian modeling and multivariate pattern analysis in fMRI test-retest reliability analysis.
- I finished my second rotation with [Dr. Janine Bijsterbosch](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/research/research-centers/computational-imaging-research-center-circ/labs/bijsterbosch-lab) where we investigated multiple strategies to improve the accuracy of fMRI network connectivity based prediction of individual traits. Our results were published on [bioArxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.04.487069).
- I will begin my first rotation in WUSTL with [Dr. ShiNung Ching](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/ShiNung-Ching.html) to investigate the function of multiple timescales in working memory and reinforcement learning through optimization and dynamic system analysis of RNN models.
- I was admitted to the [Neurosciences PhD Program](https://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/neuro/Pages/default.aspx) at Washington University in St. Louis! (Some [advice](PhD-Admission/index.html) for future Chinese applicants)
